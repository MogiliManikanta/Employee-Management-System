# Employee-Management-System
In the Employee Management System (EMS), the admin plays a crucial role in managing employee records, leave requests, and salary assignments. The admin can add new employees by entering their personal details, job information, and salary package. Once an employee is added, the admin assigns the employee to a specific department and sets the salary, which includes basic pay, bonuses, and allowances. The admin also handles leave management by reviewing and approving or rejecting leave requests made by employees. These requests include various leave types like sick, vacation, or casual leave. The admin checks the employeeâ€™s leave balance before making a decision on approval or rejection.

On the other hand, employees can request leaves through the system by specifying the leave type, start and end dates, and attaching any necessary documents. They can view the status of their leave requests (approved, rejected, or pending) and check their remaining leave balance. Additionally, employees have access to their personal information, such as job details, department, and salary, allowing them to keep track of their employment data. If needed, they can request updates to their information, which must be approved by the admin. This separation of roles ensures a smooth and efficient workflow in managing employee data, leave requests, and salary details.
